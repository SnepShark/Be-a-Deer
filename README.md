Made for 7DFPS 2023.

If you're here looking for the transformation shader, it's DogBodShader.shadergraph in the shaders folder! You can see how it's controlled by looking at TFManager.cs, and how to make textures for it by looking at deerbodsheet.png/deerfacesheet.png. Feel free to adapt this technqiue for use in your own projects!

This project won't work properly if you just try to import it into unity, as I've removed any packages that I do not have the authority to redestribute. In particular, FImpossible's [Look Animator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/look-animator-122249) and Tom Goethals' [Mirrors and reflections for VR](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/fullscreen-camera-effects/mirrors-and-reflections-for-vr-212493), which are very important to how the game works.
